                This site is for any and all who are Board Game Curious! Perhaps you grew up with the classics of Hasbro or Parker Brothers<br>
                with family game nights of Monopoly, Clue and Uno...<br></h9>
                <h9>
                Or perhaps you have already joined in on the Golden Age of Board Games that started as it did for me back in the early 00s<br>
                with the likes of Catan, Cards Against Humanity and Ticket to Ride!<br></h9>
                <h9>
                Finally, maybe you have gone through many seasons of gaming and have moved up from Gateway Games into building a collection<br> 
                and higher weight classes<br></h9>
                <h9>
                No matter your level of experience with the marvelous world of board games, you are most likely here because you are curious<br> 
                to learn something more.<br></h9>
                <h9>
                This makes you a Meeple Person and that is why you are welcome at Meeple People!<br></h9>
